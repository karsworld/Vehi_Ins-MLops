## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### 1. Create Project Template
- Run the `template.py` script to initialize the project structure.

### 2. Set Up `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml`
- Edit the `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` files to import local packages.
- Refer to the `crashcourse.txt` for detailed setup instructions.

### 3. Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
conda create -n vehicle python=3.10 -y
conda activate vehicle
```

- Add required packages to `requirements.txt` and install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify Package Installation

- Run `pip list` to confirm that all required packages are installed.

## üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Setup

### 5. Create MongoDB Atlas Account
1. Sign up for MongoDB Atlas and create a new project.
2. Create a new cluster with the "M0" service tier.
3. Set up a username, password, and DB user.

### 6. Set Up IP Access

- Add `0.0.0.0/0` in "Network Access" to allow universal access.

### 7. Get Connection String

- Copy the connection string from MongoDB Atlas and replace the password.

### 8. Set Up Notebooks

1. Create a folder called `notebook` and add the `mongoDB_demo.ipynb` file.
2. Push your dataset to MongoDB through the notebook.

### 9. Verify MongoDB Data

- Browse your MongoDB Atlas database to see the data in a key-value format.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Logging, Exception Handling, and Notebooks

### 10. Logger & Exception Handling

- Implement custom logging in the `logger.py` file and test it with `demo.py`.
- Handle exceptions in the `exception.py` file and test them.

### 11. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering

- Add EDA and feature engineering notebooks to analyze and prepare the data.

---

## üíæ Data Ingestion

### 12. Set Up MongoDB Connection

1. Define constants in `constants.__init__.py`.
2. Implement MongoDB connection in `configuration.mongo_db_connections.py`.
3. Create code in `data_access` and `entity` folders to handle data ingestion and transformation.

### 13. Configure MongoDB URL

For **Bash**:

```bash
export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>......"
```

For **PowerShell**:

```bash
$env:MONGODB_URL = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>......"
```

---

## üîé Data Validation, Transformation & Model Trainer

### 14. Data Validation

- Add code to validate the data as done in the Data Ingestion step.

### 15. Data Transformation

- Implement the Data Transformation component. Add `estimator.py` to the `entity` folder.

### 16. Model Trainer

- Implement the Model Trainer component to train your model and store the results.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Services Setup

### 17. Set Up AWS IAM

1. Create an AWS IAM user with `AdministratorAccess` policy.
2. Generate the Access Keys and set them as environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
```

### 18. AWS S3 Bucket Configuration

1. Create a new S3 bucket named `my-model-mlopsproj`.
2. Allow public access and acknowledge.

---

## üèÜ Model Evaluation & Pusher

### 19. Model Evaluation

- Implement the model evaluation step to assess the performance of your trained model.

### 20. Model Pusher

- Push the trained model to AWS S3 for storage and further use.

---

## üöÄ Prediction Pipeline

### 21. Set Up Prediction Pipeline

- Set up `app.py` for the prediction pipeline.
- Create directories like `static` and `templates` to serve the model predictions through a web interface.

---

## üîÑ CI/CD Setup

### 22. Docker & GitHub Actions Setup

1. Create a `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`.
2. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD by creating `.github/workflows/aws.yaml`.
3. Create an ECR repository for storing your Docker image.

### 23. EC2 Setup

1. Launch an EC2 Ubuntu instance and install Docker.
2. Connect to the instance and set up a self-hosted GitHub runner.

### 24. EC2 Security Group

- Open port `5000` for the EC2 instance to allow access to the prediction app.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Setup

### 25. GitHub Secrets Setup

Add the following secrets in GitHub under `Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions`:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
- `ECR_REPO`

### 26. Access the Prediction App

- After deploying the app, access it through `http://<public-ip>:5000`.
